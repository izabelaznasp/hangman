Coding  isn't a professional matter for me.

At first it was just because of obligatory classes on C++ in high school that I really liked. Then, during my studies, I had to deal with Matlab.

Finally I joined course Girls go IT funded by Motorola Solutions Foundation. I did that because I like learning new stuff and after facing some issues  in the labor market in my original field I started to wonder whether the path I've chosen before is the right one.
